# libgcnav
New and hopefully improved I have learned a bit about c now so this go around I have orginized the code a bit 
better I hope and I'm using structs and pointers corectly I think. this lib should be made up of sevral source 
files and a single header I'm going to add a make file in a bit I was working on my CORDIC lib and break time.
